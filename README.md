# Laboratory Analytical Procedures
NREL develops laboratory analytical procedures (LAPs) to provide validated methods for biofuels and pyrolysis bio-oils research.

* Biomass Compositional Analysis - These lab procedures provide tested and accepted methods for performing analyses commonly used in biofuels research.
* Bio-Oil Analysis These lab procedures allow for the analysis of raw and upgraded pyrolysis bio-oils.
* Algae Compositional Analysis These lab procedures help scientists and researchers understand more about chemical composition of algae as a feedstock to convert to biofuels.
