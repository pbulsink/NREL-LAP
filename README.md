# Laboratory Analytical Procedures
NREL develops laboratory analytical procedures (LAPs) to provide validated methods for biofuels and pyrolysis bio-oils research.

* [Biomass Compositional Analysis](./biomass-compositional-analysis.md) - These lab procedures provide tested and accepted methods for performing analyses commonly used in biofuels research.
* [Bio-Oil Analysis](./bio-oil-analysis.md) - These lab procedures allow for the analysis of raw and upgraded pyrolysis bio-oils.
* [Algae Compositional Analysis](./algae-analysis.md) - These lab procedures help scientists and researchers understand more about chemical composition of algae as a feedstock to convert to biofuels.
